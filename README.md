# tmle-methods-simulation

## Overview

This repository provides reproducible implementations and simulation studies of Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), an efficient, robust, and flexible framework for estimating average treatment effects in causal inference.

The project revisits the theoretical foundations underlying TMLE, including G-computation, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), propensity score methods, double robustness, and the efficient influence curve. Simulation studies compare TMLE with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) under both correctly specified and misspecified outcome and exposure models, evaluating performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and statistical validity.

In addition, the repository includes implementations and discussions of advanced extensions of TMLE, such as Collaborative TMLE and Cross-Validated TMLE, based on existing methodological literature.
